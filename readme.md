Pebble
======

Pebble is a tool for helping people become the people they want to be. 

You may have heard this common analogy: try filling up a glass bottle with sand and rocks. If you fill it first with the sand, you may not be able to fit all of the rocks inside. But if you first put the big rocks in the bottle, then pour the sand over them, the sand will fill in the gaps between the rocks, and you'll be able to fit everything inside.

The big rocks are things like your family, your spiritual life, your physical wellbeing, your moral character, and maybe even your career. Everyone values things slightly differently - you have to decide what the big rocks are in your own life. 

The problem with these things is that they are, well, big rocks. It's hard to know how to work on them sometimes, even though they're the most important things to us. They're a bit intangible. That's why, very often, we get caught up in the tangible busyness of the now and fail to improve ourselves in the most important ways.

The best way to deal with this problem is to break the big rocks into small pebbles - little things that you do every day to improve yourself. Do you want to increase your willpower? Break that down into doing something small and willful every day - like brushing your teeth. Do you want to improve your relationship with your family? Make a habit of paying your loved ones a small compliment every day.

**Pebble** helps you track your progress with those little pebbles. Every day, you can check off the pebbles you've accomplished. You can also track metrics like your weight or your sobriety. Pebble helps you to take life one day at a time.
